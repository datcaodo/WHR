## Data Limitations and Ethics 

There are a couple of limitations with this data set. 
First of all, happiness is a subjective measure and can vary greatly based on cultural, societal, and individual differences. The happiness scored provided in the data set may not capture the full spectrum of the individual experiences within a country. 
Second of all, there might be data accuracy problem as the data comes from surveys. 
Finally, not all countries may have comprehensive data available for all the factors included in the report which could create biases.
